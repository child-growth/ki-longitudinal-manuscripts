["QA.html", "Chapter 2 Quality assurance", " Chapter 2 Quality assurance To check for outliers in length measurements, we plotted the distribution of raw length measurements by age and sex against different percentiles of the World Health Organization child growth standard distribution. The majority of observations fell within 3 standard deviations of the mean of the standard for males and females. There were certain cohorts, such as COHORTs Guatemala, that had a larger proportion of observations outside of 3 standard deviations from the mean. There was a higher variability of length measurements in the PROBIT, ZVITAMBO, and Keneba cohorts. "],

Overall, the patterns are the same as for stunting (LAZ &lt; -2), with the peak in prevalence at ages 18-24 months and the highest incidence proportion from 0-3 months. 3.1 Age-specific severe stunting prevalence 3.2 Age-specific severe stunting incidence "],

To assess the extent to which this assumption influenced our estimates, we plotted the distribution of age at first measurement and the age at enrollment. The vast majority of children were enrolled close to birth, and the majority were less than 5 days of age at their first measurement. 5.1 Histogram of first measurement within age 0-30 days 5.1.1 All cohorts 5.1.2 Cohort-stratified 5.2 Histogram of age at enrollment 5.2.1 All cohorts 5.2.2 Cohort-stratified "],
